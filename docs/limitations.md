Relativity Trace Workspace
===========================

When Relativity Trace is installed into a workspace, that workspace is limited in Relativity functionality to provide for a streamlined approach to monitor all forms of communication (audio, email, and chat plus their attachments). This allows for a more cost-effective pricing for Trace by providing only the functionality you need for proactive compliance monitoring and surveillance.

Pricing parameters for Trace
============================

Clients buy packages of Monitored Individuals (MI). Each subscription includes a fixed amount of Trace GBs and Relativity Users.

There are 2 SKUs:
* 30 Day Retention (includes 3 Trace GBs per MI)
* 365 Day Retention (includes 40 GBs per MI)

Relativity does not enforce any retention policy; the customer can configure retention policies themselves based on any factors. 
Relativity only caps the data volumes in the software.

The Trace GBs are separate: customers cannot use an existing Relativity/RelativityOne subscription.

Relativity Users are fungible across eDiscovery and Trace workspaces.

There is no on-prem SKU; customers would buy the 30 Day Retention SKU and not use the included GBs.



Workspace capabilities and limitations
======================================

Trace SKUs include the following functionality:
* Trace-based Ingestion
* Analytics 
  1. Conceptual index

Basic Trace workspace usage workflow
====================================
Using the Trace workspace allows you to focus on the alerts generated from the Monitored Individuals in your data sources. After Trace ingests data from Monitored Individuals and pushes alerts to the Document object, reviewers can begin reviewing the alerts for true and false positives. You can then leverage Active Learning to conduct a prioritized review process of the alerts. You can also use the other tools in the Analytics suite to more quickly drill down to the true alerts.




Pricing to add eDiscovery
=========================

If you need to shift from compliance monitoring into eDiscovery, you can add eDiscovery to your Trace bundle. Too add eDiscovery, a customer must buy a package of eDiscovery GBs at standard prices. Customer can add additional users at eDiscovery rates.

Example:
* Customer has existing license of 1000 Trace MIs with a 30 day retention (includes 3 Trace TBs and 50 Relativity Users)
* Customer licenses 5 TBs for eDiscovery at eDiscovery rates
* Customer now has:
  * 1000 MIs
  * 5 RelativityOne TBs for RelativityOne Workspaces
  * 3 Trace TBs for Trace Workspaces
  * 50 Relativity Users
