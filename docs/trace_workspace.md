Relativity Trace Workspace
===========================

When Relativity Trace is installed into a workspace, that workspace is limited in Relativity functionality to provide for a streamlined approach to monitor all forms of communication (audio, email, and chat plus their attachments). This allows for a more cost-effective pricing for Trace by providing only the functionality you need for proactive compliance monitoring and surveillance.

Client cannot download applications that would enable any restricted features, or enable data to be moved to a respository workspace or cold storage. Client is responsible for hiding restricted features from its users.


Basic Trace workspace usage workflow
====================================
Using the Trace workspace allows you to focus on the alerts generated from the Monitored Individuals in your data sources. After Trace ingests data from Monitored Individuals and pushes alerts to the Document object, reviewers can begin reviewing the alerts for true and false positives. You can then leverage Active Learning to conduct a prioritized review process of the alerts. You can also use the other tools in the Analytics suite to more quickly drill down to the true alerts.
